//we have 2 ways to see the listening ports first is with ss and second is with netstat
//netstat is the simplest to use
netstat -a
//anyone interested in ss is 
// ss -l | sort | grep 31
//if you scroll a little bit you can see that there are only 3 ports between 31000-32000
//then realize you are an idiot and didn't need to do that
//use nmap
nmap -sV -T4 -p 31000-32000 localhost
//gives us 5 ports but if we see at the service only 1 does not have echo which is the wanted one 31790
ncat --ssl localhost 31790
//then we paste the current password
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
//and its gives us an RSA PRIVATE KEY
//copy the private key
//go to the tempority directory
cd /tmp
//create a new file
touch private17.key
//open and paste the private key inside
nano private17.key
//save it and exit
//change the privileges
chmod 700
//then you have access to the next level
//you need to be in the directory to access the key don't forget
ssh -i private17.key bandit17@localhost -p 2220

//go in the wanted file which is "inhere"
cd inhere
//the problem is that one only file is ascii
//i have found 2 solutions
//first solution brute force
//do this one every file
file ./-file00
//then you will find that only file07 is ascii
//the second solution is to use find to find the file that uses ascii
find . -type f -exec file {} + |grep ASCII
//which shows use that file07 is the ascii one
//then cat its content and gives us the password 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
cat ./-file07
//then exit and go to shh bandit6
exit

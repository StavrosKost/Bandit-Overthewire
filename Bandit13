//i hate this one i literally looked it up but i slittely changed it
//first you need to go to /tmp and create a new directory
cd /
cd /tmp
mkdir yo
cd 
//then copy the file and go back to your created directory
cp data.txt /tmp/yo
//then hell arrives
//its literally a ton of decompression
//so what you do is this
xxd -r data.txt data2
//then use gzip
mv data2 data2.gz
gzip -d data2.gz
//and then you will need to see the next type of file 
file data2
//it will be one of 3 bz2,gzip or tar
//if its gzip you rename the file as data2.gz
//if its bzip2 you rename the file as data2.bz2
//if its tar you rename the file as data2.tar
//then use accordingly gzip -d data2.gz or bzip2 -d data2.bz2 or tar -xf data2.tar
//eventually you will find some files that end in .bin you can skip the rename if its bzip2 or tar but if its gzip you gotta rename it
//when you find data8 the password is in it: FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn

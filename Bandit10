//first lets look at the files
ls
//we see data.txt and cat it to see whats inside, its non understandable language
//so we need to find the password
//what i find works for me is to do this
hexdump -C data.txt|grep ==
//then realize you are an idiot and you don't need to do that and its 100 times easier
//strings shows only the strings in the file
strings data.txt
//you see that there are a lot of strings and then just find the ones that are next to ==
strings data.txt | grep ==
//it gives us the password: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

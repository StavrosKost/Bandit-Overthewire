//see what files are there
ls
//we see the suconenct which is an executable
//if we try to execute it,it says that
//Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
//This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP. If it receives the correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back.
 ./suconnect
//so it also needs a port to be used
//if we use nmap we can see the open ports
nmap localhost
//then we need to set up a listening port using netcat
//nc is the netcat -l it tells it to listen and -p is to list the port and & means that it will run in the background
echo "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | nc -lp 1234 &
//then we execute the suconnect to the now listening port
./suconnect 1234
//and it gives us the next password: EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt
